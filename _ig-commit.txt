-working on Promise.all, making all refreshIni == 1 return promises at proper places
-double confirm delete profile by changing to confirmCheck
-changed profname in props of stackDOMJson to profpath as that is constant after creation :assume:
-in initProfToolkit i had localPathDefault and rootPathDefault getting set to opposite vals
-also now pushing objToSplice if it's found to be active
-on refreshIni i wasnt returning promise, doing that now.
-to reject a promise have to use Promise.reject(new Error('blah')) so i made this update
-sometiems was getting a already initalized error on the exe when doing run (line 975) so i added '-new-instance' as argument hopefully this fixes that :::  i figured it out, this is because the instance is still open. (to reproduce: create profile and keep that launch open, then try create profile again, it will give this error) ::: put in solution: no longer using myServices.proc but now just doing init every time
-when deleting more than one profile WHILE another profile is open with profilist installed, it only removes one child and the rest remain, its weird im trying to fix that right now :todo: (not yet fixed) (i think might be fixed now)
-got promise chain faield to handle a rejction on delete of custom path profile :::: (FIXED THIS: was doing remove instead of removeDir)
-SOMEHOW it is deleting profile that is in use sometimes i need to figure out what cuases this, the folders actually dont get deleted ::: figured it out, tps.profiles doesnt refresh and i wasnt breaking the while loop so it was using the last one left in memory
-changed so instead of immediate mousedown on active it goes to rename its oncommand
-is updating whenever any panel shows in panelui so im making it only when main panel shows it should run update
