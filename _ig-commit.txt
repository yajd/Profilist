-changed so stackUpdated updates all windows, this is required because on menu open it just refreshes ini and IF changed then it will update the menu, so if open in one window it updates there, then go open in another window it wont update as its already been updated
-removed dependence on querySelector for identifier, so now ident by label name even for "Create New Profile" (so removed that force rename and catastrophic failure stuff)
-updated pattern so can handle = signs in profile names
-bug: open 2 windows in Main. then in second window of Main open popup. Then from main of Main create a new profile. Then from new profile create another new profile. Then go to main window of Main and see that height of two tabs is missing so create profile button and first profile button will be missing.
