-made so detects if scrollbars vis on PUIcs, if its NOT vis then it wont hide them and do nothing on collapse, if it IS vis then it will hide them then reshow on collapse
-:todo:it looks like expandedHeight should be cumHeight - 1 but i didnt implement this
-:todo:watch out for content of stack showing someday, right now even with not specifying overflow:hidden the contents of stack doesnt show if the height is set to something less than max height
-if panel is visible and if stack is empty and stack is set to height of 38px, its weird but the box comes out to be 50px;. no matter what if stack empty set stack to whatever height, the box is always stack height + 12 UNTIL you put a child into stack, weird
-:learned: when trying to put a ProflistLoading id'ed toolbarbutton into stack it woundnt get added when first letter was caps
-tested to see how it works when os.file lags, by using settimeout and what if stack was expanded, it is modified approparately now
